<p><strong>Brienna Macnish: creative concept, lead artist, creative producer,
Clare McCracken: key collaborator, visual design,
	Robert D Jordan: key collaborator, composition, sound design and sound system design</strong></p>
<p>VILLAGE was an immersive audio documentary and installation work created over twelve months with the residents of retirement communities in Launceston, Tasmania. Through an audio-documentary that shares the stories older people, VILLAGE is a gesture towards how intergenerational connection within our communities might begin. In conjunction the audio/installation work, two participatory satellite events were run as part of VILLAGE. "Let's Talk About Death", was an advanced care directive workshop produced with Palliative Care Tasmania and "Common Ground" was a intergenerational afternoon tea connecting older and younger female leaders.</p>
<p>VILAGE was commissioned by  Junction Festival and supported by Creative Victoria, the Australia Council, significant in-kind support was provided by Word of Mouth Technology, All About Gardens, Laucneston and BMW Launceston. The project engaged with over twenty older people from five retirement communities in Launceston.</p>
	<p>This documentation demonstrates the artist's capacity for working with communities of older people, ability to build support for their work within the aged services sector and demonstrated sucess bringing non-arts industry partners (such as our audio technology provider, Word of Mouth Technology) onboard projects.</p>

<h3>Section 32 at Immerse Festival, 2016</h3>
	<p><strong>Clare McCracken: lead artist, creative producer, Brienna Macnish: key collaborator, performance director, Robert D Jordan: key collaborator, composition, sound design and sound system design, Jessie Stanley: associate artist</strong></p>
<p>Section 32 was an immersive installation that transformed the inside and outside of a suburban home into a vision of the future.</p>
<p>Exploring key themes within futurist literature such as climate change, rapid population growth, housing affordability, technological advances such as driverless cars and shifts in the labour market Section 32 looks at the way our domestic lives may change in the specific context of the Australian suburbs. Over four weeks, artists transformed a suburban house inside and out creating an immersive installation with performance that transported audiences to the end of this century to experience the future of the Australian suburbs.</p>
<p>Section 32 was supported by Knox City Council and an anonymous donor.</p>
<p>This project demonstrates that Brienna, Clare and Robert have the capacity to create large scale, high quality cross-artform installation work.</p>
