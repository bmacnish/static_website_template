<h1>About</h1>
  <h2>Brienna Macnish <small>Artist Statement</small></h2>
    <p>Brienna Macnish is a Melbourne based emerging artist who creates contemporary performance, audio experiences and installation works for unusual places and public spaces. Brienna’s work is concerned with how intimacy and immersion can be used to create physical and psychological spaces for empathy. Her practice is characterised by an interest in story-rich sites and engagement with socially relevant content that speaks to a contemporary Australian context.</p>

<p>Brienna creates physically and aurally immersive worlds where audiences are encouraged to slow down and exercise empathy. Through these encounters, that place the audience firmly at the centre the experience, Brienna constructs physical and psychological spaces for sharing stories between groups of people who have limited access to each others narratives. With a background in theatre, Brienna’s practice sits at the intersection between contemporary performance and ephemeral art in public space and draws on socially engaged, site responsive and documentary practices. Thematically, she is interested in the contemporary and changing experience of ageing in Australia, the use of public space by young people and projects that imagine and speculate upon the world of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Brienna’s work is divided into two streams, signature projects developed over a number of years and commissioned works of smaller scale. For her signature projects, Brienna takes the role of lead artist and creative producer facilitating a highly collaborative process and guiding the vision for large-scale immersive experiences. Brienna’s smaller commissioned works are often documentary audio-works developed in collaboration with specific communities for a pre-determined site. Brienna works with her partner and collaborator Robert D Jordan a sound-designer, composer and electronics developer to realise her work.</p>
